https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XGwuM_u7UeQ

* State Management
* MobX
  * Simple
  * Focused
  * Performant
  * Small core API
  * Unobtrusive
 
`"Everything that can be derived from the application state, should be derived. 
Automatically."`

## Core MobX API
 * observable `Video Time: 6:23`
 * computed `Video Time: 7:00`
 * autorun `Video Time: 8:15`
 * reaction `Video Time: 9:49`
 * transaction `Video Time: 12:55`
 * action `Video Time: 13:48`
   * will automatically run your code in a transaction. Most of time should be using mobx.action.
