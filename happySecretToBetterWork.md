# Happy Secret To Better Work

 * The absence of disease is not health.
 * External world is not predicative of our happiness.  90% of happiness is not the external world, but how our brain processes the world.
 * Job success is seeing stress as a challenge and not as a threat.


 **Wrong:** Work harder to be more successful. If more successful, then happy.
 
 **Wrong because:** If happiness is on the other side of success your brain never gets there.  Every time you have a success you just change the goal and never reach it. Success is always over the horizon. 

 ***Instead, raise someoneâ€™s positivity in the present. A positive brain performs better.***
