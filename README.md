# Reading List
Sticking my reading list TODO here (it is not all reading...).

When onboarding new talent, as well as keeping fresh myself it is important to keep up todate by reading, working through tutorials, or watching videos.

I have too many places where I stick random links, random book titles, so now I am going to start placing them here.  This way as I get rid of stuff I complete, no longer like... I can at least track my history.

I have an account at [Safari Books Online](https://www.safaribooksonline.com/accounts/login/?next=/register-topics/) that allows me to read digital copies and other cool stuff.

~~Crossed~~ off items are ones that I have completed, and found valuable enough to have it remain.
